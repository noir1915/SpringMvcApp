2. Connecting Tomcat9 to start the server from the IDE.
3. Rest API requests (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) were used to work with the application database (reading, writing, updating, deleting).
5. Communication with the database is carried out through the Pattern DAO (Data Access Object) (PrepareStatement).
6. Thymeleaf template engine was used to adequately display objects on the html page.
7. JDBC Template - a thin wrapper around the JDBC API. Part of Spring FrameWork.
8. Hibernate-Validation was also used, which sets validation rules using annotations over class fields.
